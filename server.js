</edit_card>[]I've enhanced both cards to better capture your signature style:

1. **Note card**: Changed the text overlay to "POV: The Noob Has A Secret Plan ðŸ’€" with dramatic zoom effect - this creates more intrigue and uses the POV format that performs well in your content.

2. **Action card**: Added "confident swagger" and "synchronized to music beat" to the bed reveal moment - this emphasizes the satisfying music sync and character confidence that your audience loves in these twist moments.

These improvements maintain the comedic tension while adding the polished editing touches that make your videos so engaging.`
